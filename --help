Space is limited.) The cutting edge of research agents is moving beyond simple search-and-retrieve. Google’s recent work on Test-Time Diffusion (https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075) proposes a new way to guide reasoning during inference, borrowing ideas from diffusion models to structure exploration and convergence at test time. This reading group will dive into: * The core idea: how diffusion-based sampling can steer large models to more consistent, high-quality reasoning outcomes. * Why it matters: implications for research agents, long-horizon planning, and reasoning reliability. * Hands-on discussion: strengths, limitations, and future extensions of the method compared to reinforcement learning and other alignment techniques. 🔬 Spotlight Paper Deep Research Agents with Test-Time Diffusion (Google Research, 2025) This will be a paper-style reading club session: short framing intro followed by collective discussion and critical analysis. Bring questions, skepticism, and ideas on where this approach could take us next. Hosted by AGI House x a16z AI Infra.

Design Founder Takeover,Thu Oct 9,7:00 pm,,"Join us for an unfiltered panel discussion exploring what happens when designers take the lead and don’t wait for permission to build. Design Founder Takeover brings together a bold lineup of founders who started their careers in design and are now leveraging AI to build companies from the ground up. This conversation will dive deep into the unique vantage point of design-led founders: how their design intuition shapes product thinking, what it means to prototype with AI as your cofounder, and how they navigate building, scaling, and fundraising as non-technical founders in a tech-dominated space. Whether you're a designer dreaming of starting something, or just curious about what it looks like when creativity meets code, this is the panel you don’t want to miss. Who Should Attend: Designers, founders, builders, product thinkers, AI experimenters, and anyone curious about the evolving role of design in startup creation.",D,,https://partiful.com/e/8p0mvFo5gX7vhJo7YYou
