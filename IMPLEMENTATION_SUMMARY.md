# Enhanced Event Recommendation System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive strategy for improving the SF Tech Week event recommendation system through enhanced usage tags and industry tags. The system now provides more accurate, scalable, and maintainable event recommendations.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Tag System

#### Usage Tags (15 categories)
- **Primary Goals (100 points each)**: find-cofounder, find-investors, find-angels, find-talent, find-customers
- **Secondary Goals (75 points each)**: find-advisors, find-partners, get-feedback, learn-skills, industry-insights, networking
- **Specialized Goals (80 points each)**: pitch-opportunities, fundraising, product-launch, women-specific

#### Industry Tags (25 categories)
- **Core Tech (25 points each)**: ai-ml, fintech, healthtech, edtech, cybersecurity
- **Emerging Tech (30 points each)**: blockchain, sustainability, biotech, quantum
- **Business Sectors (20 points each)**: enterprise, consumer, startup, media, gaming
- **Vertical Industries (15 points each)**: mobility, real-estate, legal, hr, sales, marketing
- **Specialized Sectors (35 points each)**: fashion-tech, food-tech, space, robotics

### 2. Improved AI Query Analysis

#### Enhanced Prompt System
- **Comprehensive tag definitions** with clear descriptions and priorities
- **Mapping strategy** for direct mentions, context clues, and intent inference
- **Synonym handling** for variations in user language
- **Priority-based extraction** focusing on user goals and industry interests

#### Smart Goal Mapping
- **Direct mapping**: "hiring engineers" → find-talent
- **Context clues**: "looking for a co-founder" → find-cofounder
- **Intent inference**: "need funding" → find-investors, find-angels
- **Industry hints**: "fashion tech startup" → fashion-tech industry

### 3. Advanced Scoring System

#### Weighted Scoring
- **Usage tags**: 75-100 points based on priority level
- **Industry tags**: 15-35 points based on category
- **Combined relevance**: 150 points bonus for usage + industry matches
- **Multiple usage**: 25 points per additional matching usage tag
- **Complementary bonus**: Additional points for related tag combinations

#### Dynamic Prioritization
- **Primary goals** always take highest priority
- **Industry alignment** provides secondary scoring
- **Time preferences** and **demographics** add contextual bonuses
- **Quality indicators** reward well-described events

### 4. Tag Validation System

#### Comprehensive Validation
- **Tag existence validation** against defined tag sets
- **Type checking** for proper data formats
- **Relationship validation** for complementary tags
- **Warning system** for unknown or deprecated tags

#### Intelligent Suggestions
- **Related tag recommendations** based on tag relationships
- **Complementary tag suggestions** for better event matching
- **Weight-based prioritization** for suggestion relevance

### 5. Enhanced Recommendation Logic

#### Improved Filtering
- **Usage tag priority** over industry tags in filtering
- **Lenient fallback** when strict filtering yields no results
- **Context-aware filtering** based on user intent
- **Quality-based ranking** for better event selection

#### Better AI Refinement
- **Priority-based ranking** in AI prompts
- **Detailed explanations** for event selections
- **Context-aware reasoning** for recommendation rationale
- **Comprehensive event analysis** including all tag types
