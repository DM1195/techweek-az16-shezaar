Space is limited.) Large language models are increasingly capable, but they‚Äôre still prone to one of their most frustrating and fundamental flaws: hallucinations. Why do models confidently state things that aren‚Äôt true, and why is this problem so stubborn? OpenAI's recent work on ""Why Language Models Hallucinate"" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664) argues that the root cause lies in how models are trained and evaluated. Current benchmarks reward guessing over honesty, incentivizing models to produce errors instead of admitting uncertainty. The paper reframes hallucinations not as mysterious glitches, but as predictable byproducts of next-word prediction and scoreboard design, and shows how better evaluation methods could shift model behavior. This reading group will dive into: *The core idea: how hallucinations arise from statistical training dynamics and evaluation incentives. *Why it matters: implications for model reliability, trust, and safe deployment of LLMs. *Hands-on discussion: what uncertainty-aware evaluations could look like, and how this perspective challenges common myths about hallucination. üî¨ Spotlight Paper Why Language Models Hallucinate (Ofir Nachum, Edwin Zhang, Adam Tauman Kalai, et al., 2025) We‚Äôre excited to have Ofir Nachum and Edwin Zhang joining us to kick off the discussion.

APIs to AI: Infrastructure repurposed,Oct-07-2025,5:30 pm,Embarcadero,"As AI agents move to production, a critical infrastructure gap has emerged: how to securely connect AI systems to existing tools and data. Model Context Protocols (MCPs) are emerging as a standard solution, and companies building production implementations are discovering surprising insights. This fireside chat brings together Jon Dahl (Co-founder and CEO, Mux) and Michael Grinich (Founder and CEO, WorkOS)‚Äîtwo technical founders who have shipped production MCP integrations. Mux discovered that years of focus on video infrastructure had created valuable primitives that were the perfect AI building blocks such as storyboard extraction for content moderation, while WorkOS solved the enterprise authentication challenges essential for secure deployments. Both saw a broader pattern: established API businesses often have infrastructure that becomes incredibly valuable for AI workflows, even when not originally designed for that purpose. This raises questions about how companies should evaluate existing assets for AI integration. Expect a candid conversation about technical realities, integration speed, and strategic considerations. Two founders discussing what works, what doesn't, and how the MCP ecosystem is rapidly evolving.

Experience the Future of Wellness,Oct-09-2025,2:00 pm,SOMA,"You‚Äôre invited to an exclusive event hosted by Autonomic Health, the company redefining preventive care by unlocking the body‚Äôs real-time operating system: the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Why it matters: The ANS regulates every major organ and function in the body. Research shows that 70‚Äì99% of people have some form of autonomic dysfunction, which is the hidden indicator/driver of most of our illnesses‚Äîfrom cardiovascular disease to chronic anxiety/depression‚Äîand is the only proven protocol for mystery illnesses (women‚Äôs health, autoimmune disorders, Long COVID, POTS, among others) where traditional diagnostics using blood panels and scans fail. Yet ANS testing remains the most under-utilized protocol in medicine. Until now, full ANS testing was hidden inside niche specialty clinics. Today, Autonomic Health invites you to a private event to experience the only FDA-approved, non-invasive, full diagnostic of the autonomic nervous system and learn how unlocking the body's operating system will transform healthcare. What to expect: (1) A fireside chat on why the nervous system is the foundation of preventive care and how AI + wearables are finally unlocking this foundational protocol for the mainstream - Dr. Joe Colombo (PhD, DNS): Considered the ‚Äúfather of the autonomic nervous system,‚Äù Dr Colombo invented the only FDA-approved ANS diagnostic, co-authored the defining medical ANS textbook, and has published 200+ papers - Dr. Swamy (MD, FACR): A leading American rheumatologist and founder of Attune Health (Beverly Hills, CA); Clinical Chief at Cedars Sinai; Education Chair at the American College of Rheumatology. (2) Live demo of a full ANS test to show how a seamless, non-invasive 15-minute diagnostic can reveal hidden dysfunction long before symptoms or labs appear (3) Optional complimentary test for a limited number of attendees, with a personalized ANS assessment and recommendations to balance their nervous system, which prevents disease, ensures daily vitality and extends health span. Attendance is by invitation only: Join us to experience firsthand the future of preventive healthcare‚Äîand why investors see the $100B+ preventive care market as one of the most exciting frontiers of the decade.

AI in Service of LifeLanguages,Oct-08-2025,7:00 pm,Mission,"This salon invites discussion on LifeLanguage companies and their use of AI as a force for good in healthcare. LifeLanguage companies specialize in building new AI models to understand the languages of life‚Äîproteins, RNA, and DNA. These companies differ from traditional biotech in that they investigate these languages not with wet-lab approaches but with GPUs. AlphaFold is a leading example in this nascent space and won the Nobel Prize last year. Since then, many startups have modeled their teams after the AlphaFold team, generating sister models that rearrange protein space to form combinations that would have taken evolution hundreds of millions of years to create. These new rearrangements have special properties for curing human disease, strengthening agriculture, and improving manufacturing. At Ecotone, our mission is to go beyond refining AlphaFold and pioneer the next frontier. Our vision is a model we call Hawaiian Diamond, capable of reading the human genome-as-a-first-language. The goal is to create a system that can generate the GPS coordinates needed by DNA-guided medications (e.g., CRISPRs) to cure all 10,000 genetic diseases. This will improve the lives of approximately 800 million people. A key design element is that the model will use one generalizable phenotype for all genetic diseases‚Äîand indeed for any observable feature. Once the coordinates for all 10,000 diseases are unearthed, the model will continue to annotate the genome, generating meaning for mysterious, unresolved sections of our DNA. This brings us closer to understanding the genome-as-a-first-language. Come and discuss over champagne and oysters (thanks to our sponsors) at a secret cozy space.

Building in the Probabilistic Era - Presented by Scribble Ventures and CIBC,Oct-06-2025,6:00 pm,SOMA,"In the pre-AI era, building products was a deterministic motion. Founders knew what they were building, users knew what they were getting, and the tension to PMF was in combining the right data and insights. But what happens when products are no longer deterministic? What changes when the product you build is determined by the user, is ever-evolving, and produces rapidly diffusing data points? In this sit-down with Nick Ryder (VP Research, Foundations @ OpenAI), Elizabeth Weil (GP @ Scribble, early executive @ Twitter), and other top ai researchers/operators, we'll talk about the new paradigm of startup development and break down how the startup funnel - from engineering to growth to marketing to finance...and even team culture - will radically and rapidly shift in the best AI startups.

It is our honor to present this unmatched urban Third Space, rich with wildlife, after 6+ years of D5WR advocacy efforts, in accordance with 8-80 Cities design principles: https://www.880cities.org Our San Francisco city Green Beltway goes from Tenderloin/Fillmore inner-city to the breath taking expansive Pacific ocean surf beach coastline shore of monumental ancient sand dunes. Fennel Doyle, who created D5WR -- a STEAM crusade to boost regenerative energy, modal shift & the green economy -- was nearly murdered on this very route 14 years ago. She is a NYC Parsons School of Design Dean's List graduate, NCAA Division 1 Ivy League Champion (with Brown University Women's Soccer team), road runner, scuba diver, dancer and acclaimed solar punk artist. She was hit by a car driver (AKA ""Death Monster"") which broke both her legs simultaneously, while she was going to Ocean Beach, to catch the Men's World Surf Competition of American OG Kelly Slater vs rising Brazilian superstar Gabriel Medina. She was released from the hospital on 11/11/11, bionic, with a titanium right leg. Luckily, Fennel fully recovered from the crash, and was able to reproduce a child. In 2020, Fennel created D5WR when schools closed during COVID for 2 years. ""In the dark shadow of death*"", Fennel and her (then 7 YO) son began going to the beach park together seeking life, energy, and observation-based learning flow state, as school. D5WR campaigned tirelessly to unlock the path for all, forever, to create health for future generations, and particularly for Black & broke folks living in the city. Health = Wealth.

This hackathon challenges developers, researchers, and builders to push the boundaries of context engineering (https://blog.langchain.com/context-engineering-for-agents/): the practice of designing how information is captured, stored, retrieved, and reused to extend an agent‚Äôs memory and decision-making capabilities. In this hackathon, builders will reimagine how agents store, share, and recall information using MongoDB Atlas, Voyage AI, and their partners. Hackers will get hands-on support and work alongside some of the best builders in the AI community. Attendees will gain access to Atlas Vector Search (https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search) and Voyage AI (https://www.voyageai.com/) embeddings‚Äî giving them what they need to push the limits of context, memory, and agentic applications.

This session dives into the 150-year history of the changing ‚Äòwhy‚Äô of work (and marriage, too!), including how the unprecedented uncertainty from AI and macroeconomic stressors is rocking our boats and ushering in a new era of growth through transformational change.

EuReality: XR Sharing and Happy Hour,Oct-07-2025,6:00 pm,SOMA,"Join XR's leading innovators to dive into how AI-driven hardware is crafting a digital reality surpassing the natural world. A decentralized and organic event that brings together top global XR founders and builders, tech investors, XR ecosystem veterans, and hardware enthusiasts. Communicate in person, share your insights and lessons on what it truly takes to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù - the highs, the lows, and everything in between. üëÄ EuReality Event: We help founders create momentum with bold visions and craftsmanship mindset in the digital reality era. ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it happen?‚Äù ------ Behind the Name: EuReality is the next frontier‚Äîa collective, interdependent digital reality where intelligent machines and synthetic data cooperate seamlessly to create a reality beyond the natural. The past few decades, defined by the fifth Kondratiev wave, marked the small-information era of electronics and the Internet. The coming sixth wave will ignite the big-information era, powered by autonomous intelligent machines‚Äîhardware in the physical world‚Äîthat will transform how humanity lives, works, and imagines the future. Looking further ahead, guided by First Principles that technology evolves in a ‚ÄòLeft-Right-Left‚Äô cycle, the next wave will bring the intelligent revolution. Robots, drones, aircrafts, and autonomous vehicles will generate vast streams of synthetic data, pushing a profound upgrade of the digital realm and crafting a digital reality that surpasses the natural world. Now is the critical window to shape this future. We stand at a paradigm crossroads: from ‚Äúhuman value comes from our labor‚Äù to ‚Äúhuman value comes from who we are.‚Äù I believe in this shift, and I have named it EuReality. Inspired by eusociality‚Äîthe highest form of social organization in biology, where individuals thrive through cooperation, specialization, and shared purpose‚Äîeureality reimagines this principle for technology. It embodies distributed intelligence: machines and systems acting collectively, like a superorganism. In the digital realm, eureality is not just an upgrade; it is an ecosystem of intelligent machines, smart hardware, and synthetic data working together to create a reality more connected, adaptive, and transformative than ever before. üëÄ This event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Agentic AI for the Enterprise: What's the Catch?,Oct-07-2025,11:30 am,Union Square (SF),"Enterprises are increasingly piloting AI agents to replace manual, disjointed processes and automate routine tasks that increase productivity‚Äì but 95% of these initiatives fail to get off the ground. Furthermore, they are woefully inadequate from a security and privacy standpoint: one compromised agent can leak proprietary models, violate data policies, or trigger cascading system failures. In this panel discussion, our experts will discuss the complexities of deploying (and scaling) enterprise AI and agents from business, technical, and operational perspectives, including empowering agents with payments and identity while ensuring broader AI security and compliance. This session is for enterprise leaders, operators, and builders who are collectively navigating the realities of implementing AI into their company workflows and achieving measurable results.

Verifiers - Fireside Chat with Will Brown,Oct-08-2025,5:30 pm,FiDi (SF),"No slides, no pitches, just war stories, patterns and anti patterns from the engineers who built RL verifiers. In RLVR, the policy learns whatever the verifier rewards. If the verifier is leaky, exploitable, or miscalibrated, you‚Äôre training on lies. This fireside is a candid, practitioner-level dive with builder who have shipped multiple verifiers across tasks (safety, code, tool use). We‚Äôll hit: - What a good verifier actually is: pairwise vs scalar scoring, sparse rewards, decomposition etc. - Generalization under shift: preventing policy-chasing, leakage, and ‚Äúreward hacking by spec ambiguity.‚Äù - Calibration & coverage: thresholds, selective prediction, human-in-the-loop only where it moves expected utility. - Sparse reward tasks: how to design verifiers when feedback is naturally scarce - detecting rare successes, using proxy signals without collapsing to spec drift, and tricks like trajectory-level verification or hierarchical reward shaping. - If time permits: RL environments and how verifiers are the key. Non-consensus takes we‚Äôll debate: - Verifiers should abstain a lot more (prevent the model from training on the wrong signal) - Train/Configure verifiers on artifacts (traces/tests), not just text. - Optimize for uncertainty quality, not mean score. Who should come: folks shipping LLMs, agents, RLVR stacks; anyone who‚Äôs been burned by a ‚Äúgood‚Äù reward model. Leave with a concrete checklist, sample specs, and a playbook to make your verifier the bottleneck on truth.

a16z AI Infra x AGI House Paper Reading Event,Oct-12-2025,2:30 pm,SOMA,"a16z AI Infra x AGI House: Deep Research Agents with Test-Time Diffusion üìç AGI House ‚Ä¢ üóì Tech Week (Apply to attend. Space is limited.) Large language models are increasingly capable, but they‚Äôre still prone to one of their most frustrating and fundamental flaws: hallucinations. Why do models confidently state things that aren‚Äôt true, and why is this problem so stubborn? OpenAI's recent work on ""Why Language Models Hallucinate"" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664) argues that the root cause lies in how models are trained and evaluated. Current benchmarks reward guessing over honesty, incentivizing models to produce errors instead of admitting uncertainty. The paper reframes hallucinations not as mysterious glitches, but as predictable byproducts of next-word prediction and scoreboard design, and shows how better evaluation methods could shift model behavior. This reading group will dive into: *The core idea: how hallucinations arise from statistical training dynamics and evaluation incentives. *Why it matters: implications for model reliability, trust, and safe deployment of LLMs. *Hands-on discussion: what uncertainty-aware evaluations could look like, and how this perspective challenges common myths about hallucination. üî¨ Spotlight Paper Why Language Models Hallucinate (Ofir Nachum, Edwin Zhang, Adam Tauman Kalai, et al., 2025) We‚Äôre excited to have Ofir Nachum and Edwin Zhang joining us to kick off the discussion. This work has generated significant buzz in the research community over the past month, and we‚Äôll use the session to critically analyze its insights, from the statistical roots of hallucination to the design of future evals.

Just use Postgres (and DuckDB): a Postgres + DuckDB Community Night,Oct-07-2025,6:00 pm,SOMA,"Elephants, ducks, we‚Äôre all from the same zoo. Join us for an evening exploring how PostgreSQL and DuckDB work better together! We'll feature talks on integrating DuckDB with existing PostgreSQL workflows, scaling analytics workloads, combining both tools for data engineering use cases, and more. The evening will include technical talks, networking, and discussions about the future of OLAP and OLTP working in harmony ‚Äì co-hosted by MotherDuck and Dagster! Agenda: **Just use Postgres (and DuckDB)** The most effective data stacks are often the simplest. This talk demonstrates how combining Postgres and DuckDB creates an elegant and robust platform, freeing you to focus on solving customer problems instead of wrestling with infrastructure. presented by Jacob Matson, Developer Advocate @ MotherDuck **Stop Fighting Your Data Platform: Modern Orchestration for High-Velocity Teams** The modern data landscape demands a new approach: specialized tools working in harmony rather than monolithic solutions trying to do everything. But how do you actually build a stack that delivers on this promise?This talk explores three fundamental principles transforming how we build data platforms: choosing the right tool for each specific job, developing locally before deploying globally, and maintaining unified observability across your entire ecosystem.Through the lens of PostgreSQL's transactional reliability, DuckDB's analytical speed, and Dagster's orchestration intelligence, you'll see how these principles create platforms that scale from your laptop to production while giving teams the visibility and confidence they need to ship reliably. presented by Alex Noonan, Developer Advocate @ Dagster Labs #SFTechWeek This event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Ugly Talk: Female Founders in SF,Oct-07-2025,6:30 pm,Mission,"In the heart of the world‚Äôs most ambitious startup scene, women founders are still being told the playing field is ‚Äúbetter than ever.‚Äù The numbers disagree. In 2025, women-led startups in the U.S. pulled just over 2% of all VC dollars ‚Äî in SF, that means the game is still mostly played without you on the roster. Even for seasoned founders, the warm-intro culture of Sand Hill Road keeps capital locked behind closed doors. Investors still pitch men on ‚Äúmarket domination‚Äù and women on ‚Äúrisk mitigation.‚Äù AI, deep tech, and SaaS get the headlines, but the bar for women to raise in those sectors sits higher ‚Äî and often comes with double the scrutiny. In a city obsessed with the ‚Äúnext big thing,‚Äù women founders are forced to prove their staying power before they‚Äôve even gotten a fair shot at scale. üéØ Why You Should Attend Because the SF hustle isn‚Äôt slowing down, and neither are the expectations. You‚Äôll hear from founders who‚Äôve raised in the most cut-throat funding climate in years, navigated the old biases wearing new disguises, and built companies that punch through without losing themselves in the process. If you‚Äôre building in tech ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs AI, enterprise, consumer apps, or the next category-breaker ‚Äî this is where you‚Äôll learn how to navigate the maze, spot the landmines, and find your people. üôã Who You‚Äôll Meet Women tech founders from pre-seed to Series B . Investors and ecosystem builders with deep roots in SF‚Äôs venture scene. Operators, mentors, and allies who‚Äôve seen the game from the inside and want it to change. üé§ Who‚Äôs on the Panel Mehak Aggarwal - Co-Founder of Sybill More panel speakers coming soon. Stay tuned! Moderator: Jenny Chen - CEO of WalktheChat Jenny runs a performance marketing and data analytics agency that used AI to drive strategic insights for global luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, Armani, and Chaumet. A recognized leader in social media and e-commerce within the fashion space, she spent 12 years in Beijing before moving to the U.S., where she lived in five cities across both coasts over 6 months before finally settling in San Francisco. üí¨ What We‚Äôll Talk About Why SF‚Äôs ‚Äúopen network‚Äù is still a closed loop without the right intros ‚Äî and how to break in. The new face of bias in venture: same double standard, now dressed in AI hype and ‚Äúmetrics discipline.‚Äù Surviving the hyper-competitive pitch circuit without burning out. What‚Äôs working right now for women raising in SaaS, AI, and other high-growth sectors. Building companies that scale on your terms, not just your investors‚Äô. ü§ù Co-hosted With Global Entrepreneurs Hub - Silicon Valley‚Äôs $1M+ ARR+ Founder Community.

TechWalk (SF),Oct-06-2025,8:30 am,Golden Gate Park,"‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWe're building a different sort of networking event for members of the Tech and SaaS communities to get outside, meet new people, and enjoy some fresh air while helping to restore a healthy balance to the day. Expect to meet founders, investors, operators, and industry experts immersed in the SF Tech, SaaS and Startup ecosystem, who value unique moments for meaningful IRL connections. ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãHow does it work? Grab some comfortable foot gear, weather-appropriate clothes, and your beverage of choice as you join fellow walk participants for a one-hour loop in the park. Your walk guides will help facilitate walking partner swaps and offer conversation starters, but we can almost guarantee a very ""natural"" flow of discussion. See what we did there? :) ‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãThis is a chance to network, share ideas, and build relationships in a healthy and refreshing addition to a busy schedule of panels, roundtables, and happy hours.
