Space is limited.) The cutting edge of research agents is moving beyond simple search-and-retrieve.

This hackathon challenges developers, researchers, and builders to push the boundaries of context engineering (https://blog.langchain.com/context-engineering-for-agents/): the practice of designing how information is captured, stored, retrieved, and reused to extend an agent’s memory and decision-making capabilities. In this hackathon, builders will reimagine how agents store, share, and recall information using MongoDB Atlas, Voyage AI, and their partners. Hackers will get hands-on support and work alongside some of the best builders in the AI community. Attendees will gain access to Atlas Vector Search (https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search) and Voyage AI (https://www.voyageai.com/) embeddings— giving them what they need to push the limits of context, memory, and agentic applications. Winning teams will receive cash and credit prizes. Our speakers and judges will be some of the top names in the industry, and we will be announcing them soon... stay tuned!

How to Build a Marketing Plan Book Launch,Oct-06-2024,5:00 pm,Downtown (SF),"Building a product is hard. Getting people to notice is harder. This book is your trusted companion from idea to adoption and revenue. It gives you practical strategies, real examples, and an 18 element framework that covers vision, strategy, and execution. Why I wrote it: • To share lessons from the Fortune 100 and startup trenches • To distill the secret sauce behind iconic tech brands • To bring you the wisdom of leaders who built them What you will learn: • Position with precision so your value is unmistakably clear • Use story to connect before the rational pitch even begins • Build consistency across every touchpoint so trust compounds Who it is for: • Startup founders who need clarity on priorities and next steps when it matters most • Marketing executives who want a timely gut check to align teams and accelerate growth What early readers say: “Justyna’s framework was a timely kick in the pants. When your startup is moving fast and resources are limited, you need a gut check to ensure nothing critical is being overlooked. Her framework ties everything together and helps align the extended team around clear focus areas.” — Scott Buchanan, CMO, Stacklok “A strong framework of pragmatic best practices. Just as StrengthsFinder shows the power of leaning into strengths, this book helps you amplify your product’s strengths with focus and discipline.” — Ethel Anderson, Account Director, Google Cloud “A compass and a roadmap.

The New Why of Work,Oct-07-2024,3:00 pm,Virtual (SF),"A four-part event series by Xapa, exploring the human edge of performance in an AI-powered world. Christine Heckart, CEO and founder of Xapa, has held executive roles at Brocade, Cisco, and Microsoft. She now leads Xapa, an AI-powered platform that helps teams build essential soft skills like empathy, adaptability, and self-awareness. AI will change what we do at work, but it may also impact the 'why' of work - purpose, growth, impact, and meaning. This session dives into the 150-year history of the changing ‘why’ of work (and marriage, too!), including how the unprecedented uncertainty from AI and macroeconomic stressors is rocking our boats and ushering in a new era of growth through transformational change. As AI takes over task execution, the real value of human workers lies elsewhere in creating meaning, navigating ambiguity, fostering alignment, and leading through uncertainty. But how do we get through this transformation, and what, specifically, is on the other side? We’ll discuss how organizations can navigate the massive disruption of AI adoption and ultimately redefine, reinvent, and reimagine “work.” This event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Winning Attention: Scaling B2B SaaS with Creators,Oct-08-2024,9:00 am,Marina,"A tactical invite-only workshop for GTM teams looking to drive real results with creator-led growth - hosted by Passionfroot. Creator marketing isn’t just for DTC brands anymore - it’s becoming one of the most efficient and scalable ways for B2B and SaaS startups to drive awareness, trust, and demand.

This tactical workshop breaks it down - from campaign planning to platform mix to real-world startup examples. Who’s this for? ​- Founders at early-stage startups - Heads of Growth or CMOs - Marketing and Demand Generation Leaders ​Space is limited - we’re keeping this one intentional and highly curated. Please RSVP to guarantee your spot. Passionfroot is the leading B2B Creator Platform helping global companies such as Replit, Rippling and Hubspot scale their GTM with creators.

EuReality: XR Sharing and Happy Hour,Oct-07-2024,6:00 pm,SOMA,"Join XR's leading innovators to dive into how AI-driven hardware is crafting a digital reality surpassing the natural world. A decentralized and organic event that brings together top global XR founders and builders, tech investors, XR ecosystem veterans, and hardware enthusiasts. Communicate in person, share your insights and lessons on what it truly takes to “build” - the highs, the lows, and everything in between. 👀 EuReality Event: We help founders create momentum with bold visions and craftsmanship mindset in the digital reality era. — “If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it happen?” ------ Behind the Name: EuReality is the next frontier—a collective, interdependent digital reality where intelligent machines and synthetic data cooperate seamlessly to create a reality beyond the natural. The past few decades, defined by the fifth Kondratiev wave, marked the small-information era of electronics and the Internet. The coming sixth wave will ignite the big-information era, powered by autonomous intelligent machines—hardware in the physical world—that will transform how humanity lives, works, and imagines the future. Looking further ahead, guided by First Principles that technology evolves in a ‘Left-Right-Left’ cycle, the next wave will bring the intelligent revolution. Robots, drones, aircrafts, and autonomous vehicles will generate vast streams of synthetic data, pushing a profound upgrade of the digital realm and crafting a digital reality that surpasses the natural world. Now is the critical window to shape this future. We stand at a paradigm crossroads: from “human value comes from our labor” to “human value comes from who we are.” I believe in this shift, and I have named it EuReality. Inspired by eusociality—the highest form of social organization in biology, where individuals thrive through cooperation, specialization, and shared purpose—eureality reimagines this principle for technology. It embodies distributed intelligence: machines and systems acting collectively, like a superorganism. In the digital realm, eureality is not just an upgrade; it is an ecosystem of intelligent machines, smart hardware, and synthetic data working together to create a reality more connected, adaptive, and transformative than ever before. 👀 This event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

AI Dev-Tools × Large-Scale Code Migration - Code & Cocktails Mixer,Oct-07-2024,4:00 pm,Union Square (SF),"VirtusLab two-in-one evening - one mixer with a light panel discussion on two DevTools themes: - AI Dev-Tools: Monorepo-aware semantic code search, mixing LSP with MCP for context-aware completions, LLM workflows and eval pipelines - Large-Scale Code Migration: migration strategy, automated refactors, migration pipelines, risk controls and metrics. Interesting things happen outside the local machine comfort zone, so let's meet and discuss what happens when AI dev-tools meet messy, mission-critical code at scale. We’re explicitly looking to discuss the “beyond individual contributor” side: scalable code changes, design governance, quality gates, migration guardrails, and project context management. On top of that, we’ll cover LLM-aware practices at the org level - things like evaluation pipelines that fit into CI, review workflows for AI-generated changes, and lightweight guardrails that keep velocity without losing control. So if this is your scope of responsibility/interest, you’ll feel at home. Bonus: After the official tech presentations - we’re going to celebrate VirtusLab’s 15-year anniversary - come raise a toast!

Agentic AI for the Enterprise: What's the Catch?,Oct-07-2024,11:30 am,Union Square (SF),"Enterprises are increasingly piloting AI agents to replace manual, disjointed processes and automate routine tasks that increase productivity– but 95% of these initiatives fail to get off the ground.

Venture Capital is once again backing companies that will stand the test of time. In this fireside chat, we explore the rise of a more enduring model of venture capital. Alongside leaders in the space who share that conviction, we’ll unpack: - What this “new wave” of VC looks like in practice - How founders can recognize and partner with aligned capital - Why old fund models are breaking — and what’s replacing them - How pre-investment support, patient timelines, and systems thinking are becoming the new standard This isn’t about slowing down. It’s about building better and for longer. Join us for an energizing and interactive conversation on the capital models and mindsets reshaping the next decade of innovation.

Verifiers - Fireside Chat with Will Brown,Oct-08-2024,5:30 pm,FiDi (SF),"No slides, no pitches, just war stories, patterns and anti patterns from the engineers who built RL verifiers. In RLVR, the policy learns whatever the verifier rewards. If the verifier is leaky, exploitable, or miscalibrated, you’re training on lies. This fireside is a candid, practitioner-level dive with builder who have shipped multiple verifiers across tasks (safety, code, tool use). We’ll hit: - What a good verifier actually is: pairwise vs scalar scoring, sparse rewards, decomposition etc. - Generalization under shift: preventing policy-chasing, leakage, and “reward hacking by spec ambiguity.” - Calibration & coverage: thresholds, selective prediction, human-in-the-loop only where it moves expected utility. - Sparse reward tasks: how to design verifiers when feedback is naturally scarce - detecting rare successes, using proxy signals without collapsing to spec drift, and tricks like trajectory-level verification or hierarchical reward shaping. - If time permits: RL environments and how verifiers are the key. Non-consensus takes we’ll debate: - Verifiers should abstain a lot more (prevent the model from training on the wrong signal) - Train/Configure verifiers on artifacts (traces/tests), not just text. - Optimize for uncertainty quality, not mean score. Who should come: folks shipping LLMs, agents, RLVR stacks; anyone who’s been burned by a “good” reward model. Leave with a concrete checklist, sample specs, and a playbook to make your verifier the bottleneck on truth.

Just use Postgres (and DuckDB): a Postgres + DuckDB Community Night,Oct-07-2024,6:00 pm,SOMA,"Elephants, ducks, we’re all from the same zoo. Join us for an evening exploring how PostgreSQL and DuckDB work better together! We'll feature talks on integrating DuckDB with existing PostgreSQL workflows, scaling analytics workloads, combining both tools for data engineering use cases, and more. The evening will include technical talks, networking, and discussions about the future of OLAP and OLTP working in harmony – co-hosted by MotherDuck and Dagster! Agenda: **Just use Postgres (and DuckDB)** The most effective data stacks are often the simplest. This talk demonstrates how combining Postgres and DuckDB creates an elegant and robust platform, freeing you to focus on solving customer problems instead of wrestling with infrastructure. presented by Jacob Matson, Developer Advocate @ MotherDuck **Stop Fighting Your Data Platform: Modern Orchestration for High-Velocity Teams** The modern data landscape demands a new approach: specialized tools working in harmony rather than monolithic solutions trying to do everything. But how do you actually build a stack that delivers on this promise?This talk explores three fundamental principles transforming how we build data platforms: choosing the right tool for each specific job, developing locally before deploying globally, and maintaining unified observability across your entire ecosystem.Through the lens of PostgreSQL's transactional reliability, DuckDB's analytical speed, and Dagster's orchestration intelligence, you'll see how these principles create platforms that scale from your laptop to production while giving teams the visibility and confidence they need to ship reliably. presented by Alex Noonan, Developer Advocate @ Dagster Labs #SFTechWeek This event is a part of #SFTechWeek—a week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Ugly Talk: Female Founders in SF,Oct-07-2024,6:30 pm,Mission,"In the heart of the world’s most ambitious startup scene, women founders are still being told the playing field is “better than ever.” The numbers disagree. In 2025, women-led startups in the U.S. pulled just over 2% of all VC dollars — in SF, that means the game is still mostly played without you on the roster. Even for seasoned founders, the warm-intro culture of Sand Hill Road keeps capital locked behind closed doors. Investors still pitch men on “market domination” and women on “risk mitigation.” AI, deep tech, and SaaS get the headlines, but the bar for women to raise in those sectors sits higher — and often comes with double the scrutiny. In a city obsessed with the “next big thing,” women founders are forced to prove their staying power before they’ve even gotten a fair shot at scale. 🎯 Why You Should Attend Because the SF hustle isn’t slowing down, and neither are the expectations. You’ll hear from founders who’ve raised in the most cut-throat funding climate in years, navigated the old biases wearing new disguises, and built companies that punch through without losing themselves in the process. If you’re building in tech — whether it’s AI, enterprise, consumer apps, or the next category-breaker — this is where you’ll learn how to navigate the maze, spot the landmines, and find your people. 🙋 Who You’ll Meet Women tech founders from pre-seed to Series B . Investors and ecosystem builders with deep roots in SF’s venture scene. Operators, mentors, and allies who’ve seen the game from the inside and want it to change. 🎤 Who’s on the Panel A VC-backed founder who just closed a competitive round in a hot sector. A second-time founder who’s faced both wins and wipeouts in SF’s funding ecosystem. An investor actively reshaping deal flow to include more women-led companies. A tech operator who’s built at scale and knows the fundraising trenches. Moderator: Jenny Tingyi Chen 💬 What We’ll Talk About Why SF’s “open network” is still a closed loop without the right intros — and how to break in. The new face of bias in venture: same double standard, now dressed in AI hype and “metrics discipline.” Surviving the hyper-competitive pitch circuit without burning out. What’s working right now for women raising in SaaS, AI, and other high-growth sectors. Building companies that scale on your terms, not just your investors’. 🤝 Co-hosted With Global Entrepreneurs Hub - Silicon Valley’s $1M+ ARR+ Founder Community. GREY Journal – Media partner spotlighting modern entrepreneurs (featured on Apple News + Google News). 🤝 Venue Partner Persona - An online identity verification platform that helps businesses, from any size and industry to collect, verify, and manage user identities throughout a customer lifecycle.

Bad Ideas Build Day,Oct-06-2024,9:00 am,SOMA,"The Bad Ideas Build Day is a collaborative & fast-paced hackathon where teams build out the best version of a deliberately ""bad"" tech idea. It's a celebration of creativity & chaos, designed to break the pressure of perfectionism and get everyone building something. We've previously run this event in 5 cities across the UK and at NY Tech Week with 100+ students in attendance, & have had a consistent stream of positive feedback. It’s the kind of event people ask us to run again (and again) and we’re so excited to bring the magic to a new city 👩🏼‍💻👩🏽‍💻👩🏾‍💻 ✨ This event is aimed at women with a background in STEM & an interest in entrepreneurship ✨ Thank you to Codecademy for providing one month of free Codecademy Pro to our Build Day participants (details for this will be sent out after registration) _______________________________ The Tech Bros is a venture programme supporting the next generation of female-founded tech companies.
