a16z AI Infra x AGI House Paper Reading Event,Oct-12-2025,2:30 pm,SOMA,"a16z AI Infra x AGI House: Deep Research Agents with Test-Time Diffusion üìç AGI House ‚Ä¢ üóì Tech Week (Apply to attend. Space is limited.) Large language models are increasingly capable, but they‚Äôre still prone to one of their most frustrating and fundamental flaws: hallucinations. Why do models confidently state things that aren‚Äôt true, and why is this problem so stubborn? OpenAI's recent work on ""Why Language Models Hallucinate"" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04664) argues that the root cause lies in how models are trained and evaluated. Current benchmarks reward guessing over honesty, incentivizing models to produce errors instead of admitting uncertainty. The paper reframes hallucinations not as mysterious glitches, but as predictable byproducts of next-word prediction and scoreboard design, and shows how better evaluation methods could shift model behavior. This reading group will dive into: *The core idea: how hallucinations arise from statistical training dynamics and evaluation incentives. *Why it matters: implications for model reliability, trust, and safe deployment of LLMs. *Hands-on discussion: what uncertainty-aware evaluations could look like, and how this perspective challenges common myths about hallucination. üî¨ Spotlight Paper Why Language Models Hallucinate (Ofir Nachum, Edwin Zhang, Adam Tauman Kalai, et al., 2025) We‚Äôre excited to have Ofir Nachum and Edwin Zhang joining us to kick off the discussion. This work has generated significant buzz in the research community over the past month, and we‚Äôll use the session to critically analyze its insights, from the statistical roots of hallucination to the design of future evals.

Scaling Reliability with AI ‚Äì Rooftop Views of SF w/ Rootly AI x Elastic x Endor Labs,Oct-06-2025,5:00 pm,Union Square (SF),"Join Rootly AI, Elastic, Endor Labs, and Block for a SF Tech Week rooftop kickoff with stunning San Francisco views. Expect sharp panel insights on incident reliability and AI-powered observability, then stick around for happy hour, bites, and conversations with engineering leaders, SREs, and AI builders shaping the future of reliability. ‚ÄãAbout Rootly AI ‚Äã‚ÄãRootly is the AI-native on-call and incident response platform that provides proactive support to help Site Reliability Engineers resolve incidents faster, improve system resilience, and streamline on-call operations. It‚Äôs your always-on SRE copilot that automates root cause analysis and identifies patterns that drive continuous improvement‚Äîtrusted by hundreds of companies like LinkedIn, NVIDIA, Replit, Elastic, Canva, Clay, Tripadvisor, and Shell. About Elastic Elastic, the Search AI Company, integrates its deep expertise in search technology with artificial intelligence to help everyone transform all of their data into answers, actions, and outcomes. Elastic's Search AI Platform ‚Äî the foundation for its search, observability, and security solutions ‚Äî is used by thousands of companies, including more than 50% of the Fortune 500. Learn more at elastic.co. About Endor Labs Endor Labs is an application security platform created by practitioners, academics, and builders who are experts in software supply chain security. We believe the biggest problem in AppSec today is that fixing risk is too hard‚Äîbecause security and development teams work differently. And now with AI generating more code than ever, that gap is only growing. Endor Labs bridges it by showing security teams what‚Äôs actually exploitable and what could break if you make a change. That way, you can have a smart conversation with developers about what to fix now, fix later, or fix never. ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãPhotography Disclaimer: Please note that filming/photography is taking place at the event for promotional and archival purposes.

Building in the Probabilistic Era - Presented by Scribble Ventures and CIBC,Oct-06-2025,6:00 pm,SOMA,"In the pre-AI era, building products was a deterministic motion. Founders knew what they were building, users knew what they were getting, and the tension to PMF was in combining the right data and insights. But what happens when products are no longer deterministic? What changes when the product you build is determined by the user, is ever-evolving, and produces rapidly diffusing data points? In this sit-down with Nick Ryder (VP Research, Foundations @ OpenAI), Elizabeth Weil (GP @ Scribble, early executive @ Twitter), and other top ai researchers/operators, we'll talk about the new paradigm of startup development and break down how the startup funnel - from engineering to growth to marketing to finance...and even team culture - will radically and rapidly shift in the best AI startups.

The New Why of Work,Oct-07-2025,3:00 pm,Virtual (SF),"A four-part event series by Xapa, exploring the human edge of performance in an AI-powered world. Christine Heckart, CEO and founder of Xapa, has held executive roles at Brocade, Cisco, and Microsoft. She now leads Xapa, an AI-powered platform that helps teams build essential soft skills like empathy, adaptability, and self-awareness.

We‚Äôll discuss how organizations can navigate the massive disruption of AI adoption and ultimately redefine, reinvent, and reimagine ‚Äúwork.‚Äù This event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

APIs to AI: Infrastructure repurposed,Oct-07-2025,5:30 pm,Embarcadero,"As AI agents move to production, a critical infrastructure gap has emerged: how to securely connect AI systems to existing tools and data. Model Context Protocols (MCPs) are emerging as a standard solution, and companies building production implementations are discovering surprising insights. This fireside chat brings together Jon Dahl (Co-founder and CEO, Mux) and Michael Grinich (Founder and CEO, WorkOS)‚Äîtwo technical founders who have shipped production MCP integrations. Mux discovered that years of focus on video infrastructure had created valuable primitives that were the perfect AI building blocks such as storyboard extraction for content moderation, while WorkOS solved the enterprise authentication challenges essential for secure deployments. Both saw a broader pattern: established API businesses often have infrastructure that becomes incredibly valuable for AI workflows, even when not originally designed for that purpose. This raises questions about how companies should evaluate existing assets for AI integration. Expect a candid conversation about technical realities, integration speed, and strategic considerations.

The evening will include technical talks, networking, and discussions about the future of OLAP and OLTP working in harmony ‚Äì co-hosted by MotherDuck and Dagster! Agenda: **Just use Postgres (and DuckDB)** The most effective data stacks are often the simplest. This talk demonstrates how combining Postgres and DuckDB creates an elegant and robust platform, freeing you to focus on solving customer problems instead of wrestling with infrastructure. presented by Jacob Matson, Developer Advocate @ MotherDuck **Stop Fighting Your Data Platform: Modern Orchestration for High-Velocity Teams** The modern data landscape demands a new approach: specialized tools working in harmony rather than monolithic solutions trying to do everything. But how do you actually build a stack that delivers on this promise?This talk explores three fundamental principles transforming how we build data platforms: choosing the right tool for each specific job, developing locally before deploying globally, and maintaining unified observability across your entire ecosystem.Through the lens of PostgreSQL's transactional reliability, DuckDB's analytical speed, and Dagster's orchestration intelligence, you'll see how these principles create platforms that scale from your laptop to production while giving teams the visibility and confidence they need to ship reliably. presented by Alex Noonan, Developer Advocate @ Dagster Labs #SFTechWeek This event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

A decentralized and organic event that brings together top global XR founders and builders, tech investors, XR ecosystem veterans, and hardware enthusiasts. Communicate in person, share your insights and lessons on what it truly takes to ‚Äúbuild‚Äù - the highs, the lows, and everything in between. üëÄ EuReality Event: We help founders create momentum with bold visions and craftsmanship mindset in the digital reality era. ‚Äî ‚ÄúIf a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, did it happen?‚Äù ------ Behind the Name: EuReality is the next frontier‚Äîa collective, interdependent digital reality where intelligent machines and synthetic data cooperate seamlessly to create a reality beyond the natural. The past few decades, defined by the fifth Kondratiev wave, marked the small-information era of electronics and the Internet. The coming sixth wave will ignite the big-information era, powered by autonomous intelligent machines‚Äîhardware in the physical world‚Äîthat will transform how humanity lives, works, and imagines the future. Looking further ahead, guided by First Principles that technology evolves in a ‚ÄòLeft-Right-Left‚Äô cycle, the next wave will bring the intelligent revolution. Robots, drones, aircrafts, and autonomous vehicles will generate vast streams of synthetic data, pushing a profound upgrade of the digital realm and crafting a digital reality that surpasses the natural world. Now is the critical window to shape this future. We stand at a paradigm crossroads: from ‚Äúhuman value comes from our labor‚Äù to ‚Äúhuman value comes from who we are.‚Äù I believe in this shift, and I have named it EuReality. Inspired by eusociality‚Äîthe highest form of social organization in biology, where individuals thrive through cooperation, specialization, and shared purpose‚Äîeureality reimagines this principle for technology. It embodies distributed intelligence: machines and systems acting collectively, like a superorganism. In the digital realm, eureality is not just an upgrade; it is an ecosystem of intelligent machines, smart hardware, and synthetic data working together to create a reality more connected, adaptive, and transformative than ever before. üëÄ This event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

AI in construction tech,Oct-08-2025,5:00 pm,Palo Alto,"In the era of rapid technological progress, we often underestimate how deeply the built world shapes our lives. While Silicon Valley races toward AGI, construction, one of the oldest yet most critical industries, still struggles with inefficiencies that touch us every day.

At this SF Tech Week event, Surfaice, we will dive into the challenges the industry faces today and how AI is reshaping its future. The conversation will feature: ‚Äì Experienced entrepreneurs building next-generation software companies ‚Äì VCs focused on construction tech and AI ‚Äì Startup founders with deep AI expertise (from Google DeepMind, Stanford PhDs, and beyond) Join us to explore how AI can unlock massive productivity gains in construction and transform one of the world‚Äôs most important industries.

Verifiers - Fireside Chat with Will Brown,Oct-08-2025,5:30 pm,FiDi (SF),"No slides, no pitches, just war stories, patterns and anti patterns from the engineers who built RL verifiers. In RLVR, the policy learns whatever the verifier rewards. If the verifier is leaky, exploitable, or miscalibrated, you‚Äôre training on lies. This fireside is a candid, practitioner-level dive with builder who have shipped multiple verifiers across tasks (safety, code, tool use). We‚Äôll hit: - What a good verifier actually is: pairwise vs scalar scoring, sparse rewards, decomposition etc. - Generalization under shift: preventing policy-chasing, leakage, and ‚Äúreward hacking by spec ambiguity.‚Äù - Calibration & coverage: thresholds, selective prediction, human-in-the-loop only where it moves expected utility. - Sparse reward tasks: how to design verifiers when feedback is naturally scarce - detecting rare successes, using proxy signals without collapsing to spec drift, and tricks like trajectory-level verification or hierarchical reward shaping. - If time permits: RL environments and how verifiers are the key. Non-consensus takes we‚Äôll debate: - Verifiers should abstain a lot more (prevent the model from training on the wrong signal) - Train/Configure verifiers on artifacts (traces/tests), not just text. - Optimize for uncertainty quality, not mean score. Who should come: folks shipping LLMs, agents, RLVR stacks; anyone who‚Äôs been burned by a ‚Äúgood‚Äù reward model. Leave with a concrete checklist, sample specs, and a playbook to make your verifier the bottleneck on truth.

AI in Service of LifeLanguages,Oct-08-2025,7:00 pm,Mission,"This salon invites discussion on LifeLanguage companies and their use of AI as a force for good in healthcare. LifeLanguage companies specialize in building new AI models to understand the languages of life‚Äîproteins, RNA, and DNA. These companies differ from traditional biotech in that they investigate these languages not with wet-lab approaches but with GPUs. AlphaFold is a leading example in this nascent space and won the Nobel Prize last year. Since then, many startups have modeled their teams after the AlphaFold team, generating sister models that rearrange protein space to form combinations that would have taken evolution hundreds of millions of years to create. These new rearrangements have special properties for curing human disease, strengthening agriculture, and improving manufacturing. At Ecotone, our mission is to go beyond refining AlphaFold and pioneer the next frontier. Our vision is a model we call Hawaiian Diamond, capable of reading the human genome-as-a-first-language. The goal is to create a system that can generate the GPS coordinates needed by DNA-guided medications (e.g., CRISPRs) to cure all 10,000 genetic diseases. This will improve the lives of approximately 800 million people. A key design element is that the model will use one generalizable phenotype for all genetic diseases‚Äîand indeed for any observable feature. Once the coordinates for all 10,000 diseases are unearthed, the model will continue to annotate the genome, generating meaning for mysterious, unresolved sections of our DNA. This brings us closer to understanding the genome-as-a-first-language. Come and discuss over champagne and oysters (thanks to our sponsors) at a secret cozy space.

It is our honor to present this unmatched urban Third Space, rich with wildlife, after 6+ years of D5WR advocacy efforts, in accordance with 8-80 Cities design principles: https://www.880cities.org Our San Francisco city Green Beltway goes from Tenderloin/Fillmore inner-city to the breath taking expansive Pacific ocean surf beach coastline shore of monumental ancient sand dunes. Fennel Doyle, who created D5WR -- a STEAM crusade to boost regenerative energy, modal shift & the green economy -- was nearly murdered on this very route 14 years ago. She is a NYC Parsons School of Design Dean's List graduate, NCAA Division 1 Ivy League Champion (with Brown University Women's Soccer team), road runner, scuba diver, dancer and acclaimed solar punk artist. She was hit by a car driver (AKA ""Death Monster"") which broke both her legs simultaneously, while she was going to Ocean Beach, to catch the Men's World Surf Competition of American OG Kelly Slater vs rising Brazilian superstar Gabriel Medina. She was released from the hospital on 11/11/11, bionic, with a titanium right leg. Luckily, Fennel fully recovered from the crash, and was able to reproduce a child. In 2020, Fennel created D5WR when schools closed during COVID for 2 years. ""In the dark shadow of death*"", Fennel and her (then 7 YO) son began going to the beach park together seeking life, energy, and observation-based learning flow state, as school. D5WR campaigned tirelessly to unlock the path for all, forever, to create health for future generations, and particularly for Black & broke folks living in the city. Health = Wealth. We go hard to clear our minds and ideate. We keep going. We hold space for youthful freestyle regenerative energy to compound peace. https://www.strava.com/athletes/67012557 #carfreeisSEXY ""Aren't You Tireddddddddd?"" - Kendrick Lamar ""Make up is science"" - Kryolan ""Let's work"" - Prince *Wu-Tang Clan We acknowledge the importance of Native American Ohlone stewardship of this land horticulture for 10,000+ years. As well as the need for grassroots action, community empowerment, and the deep connection between environmental health and social well-being, as exemplified by the powerful legacy of the Green Belt Movement's founder, Wangarƒ© Maathai, in Kenya.

New Frontiers Summit | The future of countries and societies,Oct-11-2025,9:00 am,Union Square (SF),"Nations are being reshaped by technology, mobility, and culture. Remote work, digital communities, and new governance models are challenging the role of the traditional nation-state. At the same time, ambitious builders are experimenting with internet countries, charter cities, and other bold ideas that could define how people live and work together in the decades ahead. This one-day summit brings together founders, thinkers, and policymakers to explore what comes next: How will traditional countries adapt when citizens can live and work anywhere? What new cities, communities, or ‚Äúnations on the internet‚Äù might emerge? How do we bridge visionary experiments with practical impact in the real world?

Agentic Memory & Context Engineering Hackathon,Oct-11-2025,9:00 am,Embarcadero,"We‚Äôre excited to welcome you to the hackathon hosted by MongoDB! Today‚Äôs AI agents are only as good as the context they can hold onto. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation helps, but it‚Äôs not enough to power persistent, adaptive, and truly agentic applications. This hackathon challenges developers, researchers, and builders to push the boundaries of context engineering: the practice of designing how information is captured, stored, retrieved, and reused to extend an agent‚Äôs memory and decision-making capabilities. In this hackathon, builders will reimagine how agents store, share, and recall information using MongoDB Atlas, Voyage AI, and their partners. Hackers will get hands-on support and work alongside some of the best builders in the AI community. Attendees will gain access to Atlas Vector Search and Voyage AI embeddings‚Äî giving them what they need to push the limits of context, memory, and agentic applications. Winning teams will receive cash and credit prizes. Our speakers and judges will be some of the top names in the industry, and we will be announcing them soon... stay tuned!
