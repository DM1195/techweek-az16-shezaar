Building in the Probabilistic Era - Presented by Scribble Ventures and CIBC,Oct-06-2025,6:00 pm,,"In the pre-AI era, building products was a deterministic motion. Founders knew what they were building, users knew what they were getting, and the tension to PMF was in combining the right data and insights. But what happens when products are no longer deterministic? What changes when the product you build is determined by the user, is ever-evolving, and produces rapidly diffusing data points? In this sit-down with Nick Ryder (VP Research, Foundations @ OpenAI), Elizabeth Weil (GP @ Scribble, early executive @ Twitter), and other top ai researchers/operators, we'll talk about the new paradigm of startup development and break down how the startup funnel - from engineering to growth to marketing to finance...and even team culture - will radically and rapidly shift in the best AI startups.

The New Why of Work,Oct-07-2025,3:00 pm,Virtual (SF),"A four-part event series by Xapa, exploring the human edge of performance in an AI-powered world. Christine Heckart, CEO and founder of Xapa, has held executive roles at Brocade, Cisco, and Microsoft. She now leads Xapa, an AI-powered platform that helps teams build essential soft skills like empathy, adaptability, and self-awareness. AI will change what we do at work, but it may also impact the 'why' of work - purpose, growth, impact, and meaning. This session dives into the 150-year history of the changing ‚Äòwhy‚Äô of work (and marriage, too!), including how the unprecedented uncertainty from AI and macroeconomic stressors is rocking our boats and ushering in a new era of growth through transformational change. As AI takes over task execution, the real value of human workers lies elsewhere in creating meaning, navigating ambiguity, fostering alignment, and leading through uncertainty. But how do we get through this transformation, and what, specifically, is on the other side?

The past few decades, defined by the fifth Kondratiev wave, marked the small-information era of electronics and the Internet. The coming sixth wave will ignite the big-information era, powered by autonomous intelligent machines‚Äîhardware in the physical world‚Äîthat will transform how humanity lives, works, and imagines the future. Looking further ahead, guided by First Principles that technology evolves in a ‚ÄòLeft-Right-Left‚Äô cycle, the next wave will bring the intelligent revolution. Robots, drones, aircrafts, and autonomous vehicles will generate vast streams of synthetic data, pushing a profound upgrade of the digital realm and crafting a digital reality that surpasses the natural world. Now is the critical window to shape this future. We stand at a paradigm crossroads: from ‚Äúhuman value comes from our labor‚Äù to ‚Äúhuman value comes from who we are.‚Äù I believe in this shift, and I have named it EuReality. Inspired by eusociality‚Äîthe highest form of social organization in biology, where individuals thrive through cooperation, specialization, and shared purpose‚Äîeureality reimagines this principle for technology. It embodies distributed intelligence: machines and systems acting collectively, like a superorganism. In the digital realm, eureality is not just an upgrade; it is an ecosystem of intelligent machines, smart hardware, and synthetic data working together to create a reality more connected, adaptive, and transformative than ever before. üëÄ This event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Verifiers - Fireside Chat with Will Brown,Oct-08-2025,5:30 pm,FiDi (SF),"No slides, no pitches, just war stories, patterns and anti patterns from the engineers who built RL verifiers. In RLVR, the policy learns whatever the verifier rewards. If the verifier is leaky, exploitable, or miscalibrated, you‚Äôre training on lies. This fireside is a candid, practitioner-level dive with builder who have shipped multiple verifiers across tasks (safety, code, tool use). We‚Äôll hit: - What a good verifier actually is: pairwise vs scalar scoring, sparse rewards, decomposition etc. - Generalization under shift: preventing policy-chasing, leakage, and ‚Äúreward hacking by spec ambiguity.‚Äù - Calibration & coverage: thresholds, selective prediction, human-in-the-loop only where it moves expected utility. - Sparse reward tasks: how to design verifiers when feedback is naturally scarce - detecting rare successes, using proxy signals without collapsing to spec drift, and tricks like trajectory-level verification or hierarchical reward shaping. - If time permits: RL environments and how verifiers are the key. Non-consensus takes we‚Äôll debate: - Verifiers should abstain a lot more (prevent the model from training on the wrong signal) - Train/Configure verifiers on artifacts (traces/tests), not just text. - Optimize for uncertainty quality, not mean score. Who should come: folks shipping LLMs, agents, RLVR stacks; anyone who‚Äôs been burned by a ‚Äúgood‚Äù reward model. Leave with a concrete checklist, sample specs, and a playbook to make your verifier the bottleneck on truth.

Just use Postgres (and DuckDB): a Postgres + DuckDB Community Night,Oct-07-2025,6:00 pm,SOMA,"Elephants, ducks, we‚Äôre all from the same zoo. Join us for an evening exploring how PostgreSQL and DuckDB work better together! We'll feature talks on integrating DuckDB with existing PostgreSQL workflows, scaling analytics workloads, combining both tools for data engineering use cases, and more. The evening will include technical talks, networking, and discussions about the future of OLAP and OLTP working in harmony ‚Äì co-hosted by MotherDuck and Dagster! Agenda: **Just use Postgres (and DuckDB)** The most effective data stacks are often the simplest. This talk demonstrates how combining Postgres and DuckDB creates an elegant and robust platform, freeing you to focus on solving customer problems instead of wrestling with infrastructure. presented by Jacob Matson, Developer Advocate @ MotherDuck **Stop Fighting Your Data Platform: Modern Orchestration for High-Velocity Teams** The modern data landscape demands a new approach: specialized tools working in harmony rather than monolithic solutions trying to do everything. But how do you actually build a stack that delivers on this promise?This talk explores three fundamental principles transforming how we build data platforms: choosing the right tool for each specific job, developing locally before deploying globally, and maintaining unified observability across your entire ecosystem.Through the lens of PostgreSQL's transactional reliability, DuckDB's analytical speed, and Dagster's orchestration intelligence, you'll see how these principles create platforms that scale from your laptop to production while giving teams the visibility and confidence they need to ship reliably. presented by Alex Noonan, Developer Advocate @ Dagster Labs #SFTechWeek This event is a part of #SFTechWeek‚Äîa week of events hosted by VCs and startups to bring together the tech ecosystem.

Ugly Talk: Female Founders in SF,Oct-07-2025,6:30 pm,Mission,"In the heart of the world‚Äôs most ambitious startup scene, women founders are still being told the playing field is ‚Äúbetter than ever.‚Äù The numbers disagree. In 2025, women-led startups in the U.S. pulled just over 2% of all VC dollars ‚Äî in SF, that means the game is still mostly played without you on the roster. Even for seasoned founders, the warm-intro culture of Sand Hill Road keeps capital locked behind closed doors. Investors still pitch men on ‚Äúmarket domination‚Äù and women on ‚Äúrisk mitigation.‚Äù AI, deep tech, and SaaS get the headlines, but the bar for women to raise in those sectors sits higher ‚Äî and often comes with double the scrutiny. In a city obsessed with the ‚Äúnext big thing,‚Äù women founders are forced to prove their staying power before they‚Äôve even gotten a fair shot at scale. üéØ Why You Should Attend Because the SF hustle isn‚Äôt slowing down, and neither are the expectations. You‚Äôll hear from founders who‚Äôve raised in the most cut-throat funding climate in years, navigated the old biases wearing new disguises, and built companies that punch through without losing themselves in the process. If you‚Äôre building in tech ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs AI, enterprise, consumer apps, or the next category-breaker ‚Äî this is where you‚Äôll learn how to navigate the maze, spot the landmines, and find your people. üôã Who You‚Äôll Meet Women tech founders from pre-seed to Series B . Investors and ecosystem builders with deep roots in SF‚Äôs venture scene. Operators, mentors, and allies who‚Äôve seen the game from the inside and want it to change. üé§ Who‚Äôs on the Panel A VC-backed founder who just closed a competitive round in a hot sector. A second-time founder who‚Äôs faced both wins and wipeouts in SF‚Äôs funding ecosystem. An investor actively reshaping deal flow to include more women-led companies. A tech operator who‚Äôs built at scale and knows the fundraising trenches. Moderator: Jenny Tingyi Chen üí¨ What We‚Äôll Talk About Why SF‚Äôs ‚Äúopen network‚Äù is still a closed loop without the right intros ‚Äî and how to break in. The new face of bias in venture: same double standard, now dressed in AI hype and ‚Äúmetrics discipline.‚Äù Surviving the hyper-competitive pitch circuit without burning out. What‚Äôs working right now for women raising in SaaS, AI, and other high-growth sectors. Building companies that scale on your terms, not just your investors‚Äô. ü§ù Co-hosted With Global Entrepreneurs Hub - Silicon Valley‚Äôs $1M+ ARR+ Founder Community.
